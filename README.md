# simple-calculator

This was an exciting project demonstrating my beginner level knowlege of CSS, HTML and vanilla Javascript. It was a steep learning curve, putting everything I have learned so far into practice. While this is not yet as perfect as I wanted it to be, I want to move on to learn bigger and better things and coming back to this when I have honed my skills further.
